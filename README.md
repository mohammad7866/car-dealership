  - `POST /api/Auth/register` - Handles user registration.
  - `POST /api/Auth/login` - Manages user login.

- **Related Modules**:
  - `AuthService`: Implements business logic for user credentials, password hashing, etc.

### Detailed Car Information

**Purpose**: Provide users with exhaustive details about BMW models M3, M4, and M5, including specifications, pricing, and visual content to support purchase decisions.

- **Code Location**: 
  - Frontend: `frontend/src/components/BMWM3.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/BMWM4.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/BMWM5.tsx`

- **Description**: 
  - Each component displays model-specific data, including images and a summary of specifications.

### Customization Options

**Purpose**: Allow users to personalize their vehicle orders with additional extras, enhancing user satisfaction by tailoring features to meet individual needs.

- **Code Location**: 
  - Frontend: `frontend/src/components/CarExtras.tsx`
  - Backend: `backend/Controllers/CarExtrasController.tsx`

- **Relevant Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/CarExtras` - Retrieves available customization extras.

### Real-Time Order Processing

**Purpose**: Provide immediate feedback and status updates during order placement, keeping users informed and enhancing the transactional experience.

- **Code Location**:
  - Frontend: `frontend/src/components/OrderPage.tsx`
  - Backend: `backend/Controllers/OrderController.tsx`

- **Relevant Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/Orders/place` - Processes new orders.
  - `DELETE /api/CarExtras/{id}` - Deletes a car extra post-order confirmation.

- **Additional Components**:
  - `OrderPage`: Displays order details, handles placements, and manages feedback popups.

### Responsive Web Design

**Purpose**: Ensure the application interface is accessible and usable across all devices, providing consistent and optimized experiences for desktop and mobile users.

- **Code Location**:
  - Frontend Styling: `frontend/src/styles`

- **Description**: 
  - SCSS files within the `styles` directory contain responsive design rules ensuring adaptability and engagement on diverse devices.


### Project prerequisites:

Windows                 | Mac 
------------------------|------------------------
Microsoft Azure SQL     | [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
Node.js                 | Node.js                  |

Homebrew is an open-source package manager for macOS, helping you install and update developer tools such as Node.

If you receive an error message that GTK is missing you will need to [install](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/windows) it.
# Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment on both Windows and Mac. Follow the instructions for your operating system to install necessary tools.

## Windows Setup

### Microsoft Azure SQL

## Enterprise Considerations

### Performance

To ensure efficient performance, several strategies and best practices have been implemented in the BMW Customization App:

- **Code Optimization**: Utilized efficient algorithms and data structures for managing data and processing user requests.
- **Asset Management**: Implemented lazy loading for images and code splitting to reduce initial load time and improve performance.
- **Caching Strategies**: Utilized in-memory caching at the backend to store frequently accessed data and reduce database calls.

### Scalability

The application is designed with scalability in mind to handle growth in both user base and data volume:

- **Microservices Architecture**: The backend follows a modular design that supports easy scaling of individual components as needed.

### Robustness

Robustness is achieved through careful error handling and monitoring:

- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling mechanisms throughout the application to catch and manage exceptions gracefully.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Where possible, the application is designed to degrade gracefully, continuing to provide essential functionality even if non-critical services fail.

### Security

Security measures ensure the safety and integrity of user data and transactions:

- **Password Hashing**: Implemented hashing (using BCrypt) to securely store user passwords.
- **CSRF Protection**: Ensured Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is in place to prevent unauthorized actions.
- **HTTPS**: All data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS to protect against interception and tampering.

### Deployment

The BMW Customization App is deployed using modern cloud infrastructure, providing reliability and scalability:

- **Cloud Hosting**: The application is hosted on Azure, leveraging Azure App Service for web applications and Azure SQL Database for data storage.

## Cloning instructions
